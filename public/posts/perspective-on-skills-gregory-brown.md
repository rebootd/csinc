perspective on skills: gregory brown
------------------------------------

Thu August 11, 2011

I'm going to guess that a lot of my .Net peeps don't know who Greg Brown
is. He's is an active member of the Ruby community, and author, and all
around good guy.\
\
 I first heard of Greg because of
[Prawn](http://prawn.majesticseacreature.com/). It's a Ruby pdf library
that Greg started, and is still my favorite pdf library for Ruby. Greg
doesn't wait for other people to solve problems. He goes out and does
it. ..then someone like me comes along and benefits from the stuff Greg
wrote. (Thanks for Prawn!)\
\
 **1. What are your normal toolsets and coding environment? Meaning what
language, IDE, and OS do you use most of the time; and anything else
that comes to mind.**\
 I work in Ruby, using mostly boring standard tools, such as vim. I am
using OS X, but only because I don't want to use Ubuntu and most other
linux distros are a bit of a pain to set up on laptops. It does not
matter much though, since I tend to use standard \*nix tools that work
everywhere. Homebrew has made installing those tools on OS X much
easier, and is miles ahead of the previous attempts such as Macports and
Fink.\
\
 No matter where I use Ruby, I try to use RVM. It is the only sensible
way to work with multiple Ruby versions and implementations, IMO.\
\
 **2. Would you consider yourself pro-Microsoft, anti-Microsoft, or
neutral? Why?**\
 I'm not comfortable qualifying those thoughts on a linear
pro-neutral-anti scale. It's probably not that black and white. But here
are some random thoughts that come to mind on the topic...\
\
 Like Google and Apple, I consider Microsoft to be a vastly oversized
company that places its interests primarily on raking in money hand over
fist. Unlike Google and Apple, Microsoft doesn't produce any software
that I particularly like to use or have a need for in my day to day
life. Also, unlike Google and Apple, Microsoft's attitude towards open
source still lags significantly behind modern practices.\
\
 That said, I think the guys who work on Excel are absolute champs. This
is only because a big part of my consulting work over the years has been
helping people write more robust solutions to crazy hard problems they
managed to mostly solve in Excel. It is amazing what adept Excel users
can accomplish, even if they take the tool far beyond what it should
reasonably be used for, and that's a testament to what a powerful tool
it is.\
\
 Also, Microsoft does some amazing skunkworks project in all sorts of
weird areas, but I sort of wish the folks working on those projects
would do their research independently to increase the chance their ideas
would actually see the light of day.\
\
 **3. What personal decisions or thoughts led to your current coding
preferences?**\
 I like working in open source communities because they tend to be hot
spots for people who care about software freedom and the free culture
movement in general.\
\
 I like working in Ruby because it mostly gets out of my way and lets me
get things done. There are probably many languages I can do that in, but
Ruby seems to work best for my brain.\
\
 **4. If there was some business motivation, could you briefly explain
it?**\
 Consulting work has treated me very well over the years, but I do not
live for commercial work. I focus on building great stuff and that seems
to have worked out and kept my bills paid.\
\
 **5. What are the best points of your current coding environment?**\
 I am not very interested in tools, to be honest. Better tools and a
mastery of those tools will improve your productivity, but it won't make
you any better at figuring out the right problems to solve or the right
way to solve them.\
\
 Sorry, I'm sure that's not the answer that you were looking for, but I
suppose it's worth representing, because developers tend to emphasize
tools so much. Tools do matter, but much less than many other more
important things.\
\
 I will say that I like that my entire toolchain is trivial to set up on
any platform, and gracefully degrades to the point where I can code
productively over a SSH session. This meant a lot more to me when I was
switching between Linux, OS X, and Windows frequently, but even without
that I like the independence from the underlying platform that my tools
provide me.\
\
 **6. If applicable: What if anything do you miss from your previous
coding environment?**\
 \[did not answer\]\
\
 **7. Anything else you want to mention or promote?**\
 I am the founder of a free school for software developers, [Mendicant
University](http://university.rubymendicant.com/). It's a really great
community and though we reach a relatively small amount of people
directly through our courses, we're working on a lot of ways to reach
the community at large, so folks should keep an eye on what we're up
to.\
\
 Folks should also check out my [Practicing Ruby
newsletter](http://practicingruby.com). I've recently began work on the
second volume of it, and the first volume was extremely well received by
the community.\
\
 Lastly, I'm [@seacreature](http://twitter.com/seacreature) on twitter.
Following me there is the best way to keep up with whatever my latest
projects happen to be.\

\
 I'd consider Greg a philanthropist. Not the rich guy in the movies or
tv giving out loads of money, but a guy committed to community giving of
his own time. I'd recommend hiring him, but I'm not sure if he works
like that now. It's worth asking him though. That is, in between free
Ruby training sessions with Mendicant.\

 **UPDATE:** Greg claims to have [quit
