[apparently](http://jruby-rack.appspot.com/) you can run Ruby On Rails
on Google's App Engine. It sounds pretty easy. I'll have to try it. For
the record, I recommend [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) or
[HerokuGarden](http://herokugarden.com/) for Rails cloud service. Great
service and a really helpful team. Still, it's fun to try new stuff too.
