mono running on heroku
----------------------

Tue January 03, 2012

I don't know how but I had to link
[this](http://blog.benhall.me.uk/2012/01/experiment-deploying-c-mono-on-heroku.html).
Ben Hall apparently has C\#/Mono running on Heroku, which is highly
interesting to me.

I **really** hope he shares how he set it up.
