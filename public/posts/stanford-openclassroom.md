Here's an easy way to learn a little: Stanford's
[OpenClassroom](http://openclassroom.stanford.edu/MainFolder/HomePage.php)
online courses. There are courses on Algorithms, Databases, Unix, and
[Web
Applications](http://openclassroom.stanford.edu/MainFolder/CoursePage.php?course=WebApplications)
based on Ruby on Rails.\
\
 The site itself is interesting; it has cabapilities for interactive
lessons. One of the sessions in the test course which I looked at
(because it says not too), offers button choices throughout the video.
