[That Extra Mile](http://thatextramile.be/) is the company site for Davy
Brion. It's a nice site based on NodeJS, and Davy is a good developer. I
think he represents the sort of developer I strive to be: actively
learning and improving. He's an independent dev in Belgium, who I've
[referenced](http://csinc.heroku.com/search?query=davy%20brion) before.

Check him out if you're looking for a developer.

..and of course you can talk to [me](/contact) too.
