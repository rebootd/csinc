perspective on skills: jeff cohen
---------------------------------

Thu June 30, 2011

Jeff Cohen is a well respective developer who made the transition from
Microsoft to Ruby programming a few years ago. So Jeff is good at
understanding the differences between .Net and Ruby/Rails, and also good
at bridging the gap for people who are currently .Net developers. His
company offers training services to train people from a .Net
perspective. So I was really curious what he would have to say, and what
motivated this transition.\
\
 **1. What are your normal toolsets and coding environment? Meaning what
language, IDE, and OS do you use most of the time; and anything else
that comes to mind.**\
 Most of my coding these days is Ruby or a Ruby-based framework like
Rails, though I'm also learning to build native iOS apps. Always on a
13" MacBook Pro. I use TextMate and the bash shell for all Ruby coding,
and XCode for iOS apps.\
\
 **2. Would you consider yourself pro-Microsoft, anti-Microsoft, or
neutral? Why?**\
 I'm neutral regarding Microsoft. I will point out when they do
something well, and point out when they fall short.\
\
 **3. What personal decisions or thoughts led to your current coding
preferences?**\
 I was a longtime Microsoft developer (C/C++/ATL/MFC/C\#), from about
1996 through 2005. I switched to Ruby in 2005/2006, first developing
Rails apps on Windows, then switched to Mac. I discovered that with
natural languages like Ruby I didn't need the crutch of IntelliSense
anymore, and amazingly never missed using Visual Studio. Visual Studio
is still the best IDE, when you need an IDE. iOS apps need an IDE, and
XCode still doesn't come close to doing for Mac devs what VS does for MS
devs.\
\
 **4. If there was some business motivation, could you briefly explain
it?**\
 (N/A)\
\
 **5. What are the best points of your current coding environment?**\
 Best part of my coding environment is little dependence on a mouse.
Everything's keyboard driven. TextMate has snippets and wonderful
editing shortcuts; and I can alt-tab to an open shell to run commands as
needed.\
\
 **6. If applicable: What if anything do you miss from your previous
coding environment?**\
 The only thing I miss from my old Microsoft days is a built-in help
system. Visual Studio's "F1" context-sensitive help was outstanding.\
\
 **7. Anything else you want to mention or promote?**\
 If your team wants to learn Rails in a Windows or Mac environment, I
offer 1-day training specially suited for Microsoft devs that want to
get off the ground with Ruby on Rails. Full details at
[purpleworkshops.com](http://purpleworkshops.com) or just email me,
<jeff@purpleworkshops.com>.\
\
 I've emailed Jeff in the past just to ask some questions regarding .Net
vs. Ruby, and he's was very helpful. If I was transitioning my dev team
to Ruby, I'd definitely see about training with Jeff. I'm not just
saying that; I take notice of people who are kind and helpful when they
don't need to be.
