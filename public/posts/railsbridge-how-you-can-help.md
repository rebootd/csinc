railsbridge: how you can help
-----------------------------

Thu May 07, 2009

RailsBridge is a Ruby on Rails community that is just starting. It's
premise is to be an inclusive Rails community, and I'd like to see it
happen. Please read this [article](http://railsbridge.org/help.html) on
how you can help.

I'll put up a badge on the ComputeristSolutions site, when they have
one, linking to the RailsBridge [site](http://railsbridge.org/). What
will you do? I have another thought, but I have to discuss it with the
board before I can move forward with it.
