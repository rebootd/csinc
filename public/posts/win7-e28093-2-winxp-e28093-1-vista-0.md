win7 – 2, winxp – 1 ..vista - 0
-------------------------------

Sun June 07, 2009

I have to say I’m fairly impressed with Windows 7 thus far. There is a
minor security annoyance, but much less than which Vista still annoys
me. It also performs a lot better than Vista. WinXP still should hold
the performance bar according to
benchmarks([here](http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=3789&page=4),

[here](http://www.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/gaming-smackdown-windows-xp-vs-windows-vista-vs-windows-7-604178?artc_pg=2)),
but I don’t really see it running in VMWare Fusion on Mac. Perhaps Win7
is more virtualization friendly, or is better about file access
management. I don’t know. I do know Win7 has a quicker feel, and a much
more pleasant UI than XP and Vista.

Well if behavior is any grade, I can say Win7 is leading in the Windows
OS race. I currently have 2 Win7 vm’s, 1 WinXP vm, and 0 Vista vm’s on
my Mac. That 1 XP vm was my main development vm until recently. I’ve
been flipping between the 32bit and the 64bit Win7 machines since it
went Release Candidate. At this point, I’m only keep XP around for
legacy reasons, which should drop off not long after Win7 is RTM.

My other virtual machines are Fedora 10 and Ubuntu 9.04, which are both
very nice themselves. They just don’t have the .Net stack and tools, so
I don’t run them as much. I can use Mono in OSX so I don’t run linux
very often lately.

Visual Studio and .Net has kept me on Windows. Win7 looks to be the
first really good reason to run Windows other than .Net in a long while.
