xamarin seminars
----------------

Tue May 22, 2012

Xamarin, the Mono company from [Miguel De
Icaza](http://tirania.org/blog/) and others, publishes some nice [Mono
seminars](http://xamarin.com/seminars). It's worth checking out;
especially if you are interested in building c\# apps for Mac OSX,
Android, iOS, and linux. Oh, and you can use the same code to run on
Windows or Windows Phone.\
\
 Also, some people have managed to get c\# code
[running](http://blog.benhall.me.uk/2012/01/how-to-deploy-mono-projects-to-heroku.html)
on [Heroku](http://heroku.com), which is my favorite
[PaaS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) provider.\
\
 **Update:** If you haven't played with MonoDevelop and Mono in a while,
you're missing out. It's becoming the realization of Java's promise of
cross platform development except with out all the Java mess. Plus, Mono
has better startup performance to match good overall performance. I was
planning on Python and NodeJS as my next skill upgrades, but Mono is
getting bumped ahead of those. It should be a fairly quick upgrade for
any .Net dev.
