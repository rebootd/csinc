preview: new blog theme
-----------------------

Wed April 29, 2009

I've found a way to get a little extra time each day by chewing my food
fewer times. Do you realize how much time you waste by chewing? I've cut
the number of times I chew in half. Aside from the occasional choking
nearly to death, it's worked great. I have loads of extra seconds
everyday!Â 

One thing I've been doing with all that extra time is making a custom
theme for this blog to match the main site. It's not done, but I would
appreciate early feed back. Please compare the [main
side](http://computeristsolutions.com/index.ashx) to the [blog
preview](http://computeristsolutions.com/blog/?theme=CSInc).
