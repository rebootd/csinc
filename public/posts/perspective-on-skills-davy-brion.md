perspective on skills: davy brion

Davy Brion does some cool stuff. Seriously! Using IronRuby to leverage
[Ruby classes from
C\#](http://davybrion.com/blog/2010/09/using-ruby-classes-in-c-with-ironruby/)!!
That's just the tip of the iceberg. So Davy, like me, does a lot of
non-.Net stuff outside of work but still does a lot of .Net for paid
work. That's why I was curious what his responses would be to the 7
questions.\
\
 **1. What are your normal toolsets and coding environment? Meaning what
language, IDE, and OS do you use most of the time; and anything else
that comes to mind.**\
 at work: doing .NET with Visual Studio 2008/2010 (depending on which
project i'm working on)... We're still on XP at this client, but will
migrate to Windows 7 in a few weeks. I generally write both my C\# code
as well as my JavaScript code within Visual Studio, though for the
JavaScript i frequently just go with Notepad++, depending on how good or
bad Visual Studio has been behaving that day. We use SVN for source
control here.\
\
 at home: I prefer to use TextMate on OS X for Ruby or JavaScript
coding, with a shell to run my tests. I don't use an IDE, nor do i feel
like I need one in these languages. I do occasionally use Chrome's
debugger, but every time I feel the need to debug, I consider it a
personal failure in my coding process. Normally, by writing code in
small incremental steps covered with tests, I rarely feel like I need to
debug something. I've recently started using Git for source control for
those projects/experiments.\
\
 **2. Would you consider yourself pro-Microsoft, anti-Microsoft, or
neutral? Why?**\
 I consider myself to be neutral towards Microsoft... but I'm often very
critical of them or some of their decisions. But that's not because of
some inherent problems that I have with Microsoft or anything like that.
It's just because I'm pro-quality and because I want to be productive,
while still achieving the levels of quality that I'm happy with.
Anything that has a negative influence or impact on that balance of
productivity and quality is something I'll either try to avoid or if not
possible, be openly critical of. Regardless of which company or
community is behind it.\
\
 **3. What personal decisions or thoughts led to your current coding
preferences?**\
 just one: the desire to continuously improve as a developer\
\
 **4. If there was some business motivation, could you briefly explain
it?**\
 I'm an independent consultant/contractor... anything that enables me to
bring more value to my clients is something that i benefit from
directly. And in the long-term, I don't want to get backed into a corner
by focusing or specializing on just one technology.\
\
 **5. What are the best points of your current coding environment?**\
 for the stuff i do at home with textmate and a terminal: high
productivity and hardly any time lost due to waiting for the IDE at work
with .NET/Visual Studio: i can't really think of any at the moment... i
guess the debugger is great, if you really need to use it\
\
 **6. If applicable: What if anything do you miss from your previous
coding environment?**\
 at home: nothing whatsoever\
\
 **7. Anything else you want to mention or promote?**\
 \[did not answer\]\

 Since Davy didn't answer the promotion question, I'll do that on his
behalf. Developers who are always seeking to improve, do improve. They
play with different technologies in search of a better way or better
techniques. Those are the top developers; they produce the highest
quality products. I consider Davy Brion a top notch developer, and Davy
is an independent developer. His contact information is on his blog
site.
