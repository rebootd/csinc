First, you can find the 'For Humans' articles
[here](http://computeristsolutions.com/blog/category/for-humans.aspx).

I'm continuing my version of a simple introduction into programming
concepts. I've started what I think is a two part sub-series on Object
Oriented Programming. The goal here is to explain programming techniques
in a way that's easy to understand, and give some reasoning for
techniques which we should all be using.

Shhhh!! Don't tell anyone, but the secret agenda is to convince readers
to use techniques which are popular in the ALT.Net community. Some
complain Alt.Net is elitist, and there are some of those. Some complain
no one takes the time to explain/evanglize to regular developers and
beginners. Well, I'm trying t do that.

We've already covered Unit Testing, but we're going to cover it again
soon with a different angle. There is also Continous Integration,
Mocking, ORM, and more to cover. Don't worry if you don't know what
those are already; those are exactly the people who should keep reading.
I'm going to explain it, and it really isn't that hard. (We just like to
use fancy terms because it's fun)
