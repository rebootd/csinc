Finally got around to installing MonoMac ([see Miquel's
post](#mce_temp_url#)) and I like it. It's similar to the MonoTouch
experience with creating a MonoMac project and then editing the UI with
Interface Builder. I have to say I really like what is going on in the
Mono world. It would be really cool to have a business layer that works
across Windows, Mac, iPhone, and Android, which would leave platform
specific UI's to their own layer. Oh, and although Mono doesn't run on
WP7 so far, one could possibly chain tools together with Mono and build
something against .Net which would then run on WP7 as well. ..let me
know when you guys figure it out.

I'd like to build something more than a Hello World for MonoMac but I
need to stay focused on my already big list of projects. I'll put it on
my todo list and post here if/when I do.

Summary: MonoMac is good.
