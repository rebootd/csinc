perspective on skills
---------------------

Sat June 25, 2011

Every so often, I take stock of my career. It's motivated by 3 things:\
 1) improvement\
 2) course correction\
 3) perspective\
\
 This time around I thought I'd get some perspective from other people
to see what they've chosen. I'll be posting responses from a few
different people in the coming weeks. I asked them basically the same 7
questions; last question being a short self description or self
promotion. It only seems fair that f they take the time to respond, that
they get a little plug as well.\
\
 I like to read about other's thoughts, so please share in the comments.
If you catch my interest, I'll include you this this little series.\
\
 One of the motivations is to hear from others whether the grass really
is greener on the other side of the fence. It's pretty easy to think
that it is. Sometimes it is; sometimes its not. It's good to reflect on
yourself before you jump over though.\
\
 Well I'll leave the self-diagnosis to you, and will post the first
"interview" soon.
