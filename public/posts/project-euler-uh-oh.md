Well I blame [Antonio
Cangiano](http://twitter.com/acangiano/status/3399593157) for
[this](http://math-blog.com/2009/08/19/improve-your-math-and-programming-skills-with-project-euler/)..
last thing I needed is another distraction, but he just hit my Achilles
and gave me a new feed for my RSS reader. I like Math but haven’t done
that much since college. I also like what I do which is largely write
code. This uses both and is a tempting distraction. Drats!

  [Euler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler) (pronounced
Oy-ler) was an 18th century mathematician and physicist famous for his
work with calculus and graph theory. His work was the basis of my first
college calculus class. We studied his work on decision making and
routes (graph theory) and led into Riemann sums then integral calculus.
Euler did a lot with applied math, which ended up being my focus in
earning a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics.

  [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) is a web site with math and
programming challenges. If you like either, you’ll probably like the
site. I may have to intentionally avoid it due to my obsessive drive to
solve problems. (I’m sure I’ll do at least a few of them at some point)
