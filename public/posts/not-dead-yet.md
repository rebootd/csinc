I’m in the crunch zone for a project so posting has been infrequent.  In
lieu, please read up on SubSonic 3, which was just
[released](http://blog.wekeroad.com/subsonic/subsonic-3-0-is-released/). 
I have plans to use it in something I’ve had cooking for a while now,
and is going to get re-made.

Also, Nate Kohari is officially
[awesome](http://kohari.org/2009/07/04/microsoft-finally-realizes-im-awesome/). 
Congrats.
