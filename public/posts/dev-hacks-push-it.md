dev hacks: push it
------------------

Mon September 20, 2010

Cruising in your comfort zone doesn’t get you anywhere. If you want to
achieve, you’ll have to push yourself. New languages, new platforms, new
methodologies, new habits – all these will help you progress. Either you
will find something you like better or more fully appreciate whatever
you already do, but you have to try. Strike that! Do or do not; there is
no try. – yoda.

> **Learn a new language**

Some say learn a new language every year. The pace is up to you, but
learning a different language helps expand your thinking. I’ve done
mostly .Net/SQL for a long time now, but playing with Ruby the last
couple years has helped me be a better .Net dev. And completely changed
how I look at programming.

> **Try a new platform**

Windows programmer? Ever written code for Mac or linux? Virtual machines
makes it easy to try different platforms. Give it a shot; just write a
hello world program and see what happens.

-   <http://www.ubuntu.com/>

-   <http://www.opensuse.org/en/>

> **Use a different editor**

Visual Studio has dominated my time for a long time, but there are
alternatives. Some are pretty darn good them selves. Take a little time
to check these out:

-   VS Express <http://www.microsoft.com/express/>
-   Sharp Develop <http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/>
-   Monodevelop <http://monodevelop.com/>
-   eclipse <http://www.eclipse.org/>
-   netbeans <http://netbeans.org/>
-   VIM [Mac](http://macvim.org/) |
    [Windows](http://www.vim.org/download.php#pc)

> **Try different methodologies**

I don’t need to preach; you’ve already heard of Test-Driven development.
Go read about it and try it, but also look into classic metrologies such
as waterfall.

-   [Scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development))

-   [XP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming)

> **Start or contribute to OSS**

It’s a great way to get exposure to new ideas, and do something to help
others. I’d recommend picking something that also helps yourself. You’ll
find more motivation to work on it that way.

-   [codeplex](http://www.codeplex.com/)

> **Give a talk**

Get involved with a local user group and give a talk. I’m working on it,
and it really pushes you to do your homework… simultaneous personal and
professional growth.

> **Small things**

Play some games with your habits. Identify things you do out of habit or
comfort and do something different. Switch your mouse to the opposite
side of the keyboard, switch which pocket you your cell phone or wallet
in.

> **Motivational music**

Nobody grows when they are comfortable, but making your self
uncomfortable doesn’t have to be boring or painful; just different. In
fact, I think it’s fun. It’s best when it’s something you enjoy because
you’ll get more out of it.
