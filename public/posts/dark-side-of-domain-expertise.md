dark side of domain expertise
-----------------------------

Mon June 15, 2009

Domain expertise has a great value especially in development. In fact,
it can be crucial for success. It also has a downside. When development
becomes so engrained in the prevailing culture, it becomes easy to
continue and even encourage bad habits.

Inevitably, a certain way of doing things will evolve during a product’s
lifecycle. It becomes are part of the culture, and is learned and
repeated by new developers on the project. In knowing a codebase, it is
far too easy to think in the same manner. The path of least resistance
is sometimes the only one you see, and even when it’s not you may not
feel you have the time to change. The way its been done already is too
deep to change in time for your next release.

Been there. Done that. Many times.

I advocate TDD for many reasons. Clarity, maintainability, and
adaptability being among those. Sometimes I see code and have to wonder
what in the world was the author thinking. Not just because of style or
buggy-ness, but code that literally looked like it shouldn’t work.
Plenty of times, seen uncommented code which was as clear as mud.

Avoiding the rut while becoming a master of the domain isn’t easy. Unit
Testing is a good way to do it. You’ll learn while coding and develop
clarity in the codebase. Additionally, you will be setting the stage for
better habits and maintainability in the future.

Roy Osherove has a [.Net Unit Testing
book](http://manning.com/osherove/), which was just published. It would
be a good way to learn more about Unit Testing. It’s on my reading list.
