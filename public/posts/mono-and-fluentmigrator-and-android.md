mono and fluentmigrator ..and android
-------------------------------------

Fri October 23, 2009

I’ve got a little itch to see about making FluentMigrator run on
[Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/). I ran the [analysis
tool](http://www.mono-project.com/MoMA), which say the FM assemblies
look ok. However,
[System.Data.Sqlite.dll](http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com/) doesn’t seem to
be good. I read that it should work on mono, and even if not there is
[Mono.Data.Sqlite](http://mono-project.com/SQLite).

I think it would just be cool to do this, but it would also let FM run
on Linux and Mac with Mono. That would rock! People could write C\# on
Mac or Linux, and use FM. Now we’d probably need to add support for more
databases, but I’d like to see that happen anyway.

So a secondary part of wanting this, is knowing that Mono can run on
Android. I think Android is going to be big, and that its getting close
to a huge growth phase. \[I missed [James
Britt](http://www.jamesbritt.com/2009/10/19/j-ruby-and-android-development)’s
Android and JRuby talk last night.\] While I’m happy to learn other
languages, being able to use C\# in new ways on a new device would be a
whole lotta fun.

If anyone out there would like to help or offer guidance, you can reach
me through the
[contact](http://computeristsolutions.com/contact/mailform.ashx) page.
Or post to the [FM google
group](http://groups.google.com/group/fluentmigrator-google-group).
