Raganwald (Regenald Braithwaite) had an [interesting
post](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2009-06-26/no_hire.md#readme)
on github about hiring practices of some companies. To my knowledge I’ve
never been subject to such practices. It’s a bit off-topic here but it
spurned some thought for me. I’d much rather hire or have hired to work
with a person who is imminently qualified and skilled than someone with
whom I politically align. In fact, I often work with (and work well
with) people who don’t agree with me politically. It can actually be
more fun to hear other people’s opinions but it doesn’t matter as far as
the job goes. Let’s all agree to be professional when it comes to
getting things done, and we’ll all get along just fine. Personally, I
get along with pretty much everyone I work with.

Also, Raganwald used an example of a law in the Province of Ontario
where it’s illegal to ask in an interview about a candidate’s marital
status. I’m not sure I care for that law but then I wouldn’t care
whether a person is an unmarried woman likely to get married and leave.
It’s about the job performance. I’d want to hire the best person for the
job even if they are likely to leave; granted I’d do what I could to
prevent or delay that. Honestly, I would be interested in knowing a
little about the person just because. I just like people I guess.

I’m fairly conscious of what I post publicly but still manage to make
gaffes on occasion. Point is just be professional, hire good people, and
have some understanding.
