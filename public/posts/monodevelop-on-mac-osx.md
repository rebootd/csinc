monodevelop on mac osx
----------------------

Wed May 06, 2009

I saw [this](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2009/May-05-1.html)
yesterday and thought how cool it was, and decided that it's worth
spreading the word. MonoDevelop on OSX now integrates with OSX, and you
can work on ASP.NET MVC projects. That's very cool. A little while ago I
also saw you can [build
Silverlight](http://www.eclipse4sl.org/download/mac/) apps on MAC as
well.

This is very cool stuff indeed! I've written some Mono apps and it does
really work, but noone should be surprised. The devs building it are
some very smart people like [Miquel De Icaza](http://tirania.org/blog/).

I've added both Silverlight code on Mac and making a Monodevelop project
on Mac to my list of things to do. This list has gone from longer than
my arm to taller than I am. Thank goodness for my [time saving
technique](http://computeristsolutions.com/blog/post/Preview-New-Blog-Theme.aspx).
