A lot of people think programming is alien and beyond their
comprehension. While some people have more aptitude for it, it's not as
difficult to understand as most people think. Also, there's a segment of
developers who haven't been exposed to some better ideas or just haven't
heard it explained in a way that makes sense. That's really who I'm
trying to reach with these articles. Building software is hard, but not
as incomprehensible as some think. And some of those new fangled ideas
you may hear about, aren't so bizarre. In fact, they would most likely
make your job more easier and more fun if you are a developer.\

**What's coming up**\
\
In a round about way, I'm introducing some object oriented principles
with deeper topics on the horizon. (think IoC/DI) Even the way I'm
getting to it is on purpose. Except for the IT intro article which was
inspired exactly how it says; by a friend/feedback. So the goal here is
to explain things in simple terms, and be fairly easy to read. Your
feedback helps and is considered.\
\
I have two ideas for the next post but I'm not going to let the cat out
of the bag yet. Still haven't decided which to go with next. One of them
has something to do with the corny/pun-like term "ICanHazCheezburger".
Don't worry; I will use that idea at some point even if its not next.
It's just to corny for me to not share.\
\
Breaking things down to their simplest part makes it easier to
comprehend. We're headed in that direction with this series, but there's
still some things left to cover before we get to the real meat. So stay
tuned and see what ridiculous thing I say next. Even I don't know
sometimes.\
