nosql thought challenge
-----------------------

Fri February 19, 2010

This is just a quick public challenge. I’m big on challenging habits and
decisions based on tradition. Using an RDBMS by default for your
application is a common thing most of us do; myself included. While I’m
not taking a position on the rise of NOSQL, I encourage everyone to
challenger their thinking on using RDBMS. Why do you use it? Is it
really the right solution for your data needs?

Please read these posts from Rob Conery, and then think about it.

[Hello from 2020](http://blog.wekeroad.com/2009/12/31/hello-from-2020),

NOSQL](http://blog.wekeroad.com/2010/02/05/reporting-in-nosql) and

Also, found
[this](http://highscalability.com/blog/2010/2/16/seven-signs-you-may-need-a-nosql-database.html)
from High Scalability website.

I’ve brought this up with colleagues and got some interesting blow back
from some of them. My point is that you should question all of you’re
technology decisions; not just whether to user WPF or Silverlight, etc.
I’ll probably play with something link
[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Home) when I get a chance.
There is a nice little screencast about the MongoMapper for rails on
[Railscasts](http://railscasts.com/episodes/194-mongodb-and-mongomapper).
