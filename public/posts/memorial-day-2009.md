memorial day 2009
-----------------

Mon May 25, 2009

This isn’t the usual topic here, but I wanted to point out that today is
Memorial Day here in the USA. It is a day we memorialize those who have
died in the service of our country. On Veteran’s Day we honor all those
who served. My dad served and is still living. There is at least one
member of the local .Net user group who also served. Just to let you
know.
