and the 2009 scottgu vip ticket winner is..
-------------------------------------------

Tue May 19, 2009

After a highly complex, random process, a winner has been chosen. The
details of said process are beyond the scope of this post. Suffice it to
say, it involved a large rotating wheel, dart, blindfold, 11 attempts to
hit the spinning wheel, and a twelfth time from 3 feet away while
peeking to get it to stick...

Congratulations, Mark Turner!

Information needed to get past security will be provided to the
necessary people. The security detail has been provided with pictures,
details, and aliases for those who didn't make the cut. Don't bother
showing up. (Absolutely & Completely Joking)

A reminder, attendance is required to receive the copies of Vista,
Office, and Visual Studio 2008 Pro.
