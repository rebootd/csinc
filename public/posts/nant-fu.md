I have been known to write some [nant](http://nant.sourceforge.net/)
build files, but am far from a nant ninja. I started with it some years
ago as part of working with CruiseControl.Net for automated builds. I
did enough to get the build going and little else. It was also before I
really got into TDD, so my scripts lacked tests and coverage reports.

After that, I’ve relied mostly on msbuild for command line compilations.
It’s pretty easy with a couple options. You should [look it
up](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms164311.aspx). You can even
use it to script your build.

I’m starting to write some nant scripts again for our projects and now
that I use more TDD, I’m going to have the scripts run the tests too.
But what else should it do…

What’s you best build script trick or practise? Could be msbuild or
nant, or whatever. I’m curious, and it would be good to share with
everyone. Please make leave comment. Thanks.
