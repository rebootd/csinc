dumping existing schema with fluentmigrator
-------------------------------------------

Mon April 18, 2011

I whipped this [gist](https://gist.github.com/924680) together for my
paid job. It's just an example of how to write a FluentMigrator
migration from an existing sql server. Feel free to comment or
contribute code if it's not perfect. Which I'm sure it's not.\
