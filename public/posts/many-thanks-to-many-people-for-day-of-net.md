Mon May 10, 2010

May 10th, 2010 is the annual Day of .Net in Phoenix (Scottsdale
actually).  It’s a great event from
[@AZGroups](http://twitter.com/azgroups), organized by
[@ScottCate](http://twitter.com/scottcate).  I just wanted to say thanks
to him, and this years speakers:

Scott Guthrie ([@ScottGu](http://twitter.com/scottgu)), Scott Hanselman
([@shanselman](http://twitter.com/shanselman)), Jeff Palermo
([@jeffreypalermo](http://twitter.com/jeffreypalermo))

I also helped put together a short introduction video for Hanselman just
for fun.  I had help, and couldn’t have done it without them.  Rob
Conery ([@robconery](http://twitter.com/robconery)), Glenn Block
([@gblock](http://twitter.com/gblock)), Brad
Wilson([@bradwilson](http://twitter.com/bradwilson)), and Scott
Densmore([@scottdensmore](http://twitter.com/scottdensmore)).  Thank you
all!  Especially Rob, without whom it would have not turned out as
nicely as it did.  He used his powers of creativity & video editing to
turn my steamy dung pile into something nice and funny.  (plug: you can
see more of his magical powers at [tekpub.com](http://tekpub.com))

Now the bad news.. we weren’t able to get the video into the event. 
Just ran out of time.  Very sorry.
