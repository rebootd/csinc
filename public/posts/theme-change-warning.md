theme change warning
--------------------

Wed May 13, 2009

I'm going to move forward with the theme change for this blog in the
next few days or week. There will be a couple of drawbacks. Some posts
may appear odd with bad font or styles. This is a result of how I
originally composed them, and, in some cases, the extensions that were
used to render some content.

I'm going to start composing with Windows Live Writer, which will help
with all the above issues. I will update older posts using Live Writer
which have glaring problems, but feel free to bring any that I miss to
our attention.

I'm moving forward with the theme change because it is an improvement on
the overall site and gives the blog a more integrated feel. This is an
important part of user experience with any application. It represents
Computerist Solutions better to apply the same principle on our site as
with our products. As with any of our products, please send feedback and
let us know of any problems.

Thanks,
