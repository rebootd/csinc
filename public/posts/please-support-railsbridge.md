please support railsbridge
--------------------------

Mon May 04, 2009

Whether you are involved with Rails or would like to be, please suport
RailsBridge. I first heard about it on
[afreshcup.com](http://afreshcup.com/) (by [Mike
Gunderloy](http://twitter.com/MikeG1)) so I'll link the announcement
overÂ [there](http://afreshcup.com/2009/05/04/announcing-railsbridge/).

The main purpose is to be a kinder, gentler, non-vulgar Rails community.
Here is the [home page](http://railsbridge.org/), and here is the
[Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/railsbridge?pli=1).
