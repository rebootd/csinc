fireworks and nosql
-------------------

Mon August 23, 2010

It’s official! And this is my way of keeping enough pressure on myself
to stay focused. I’ll be doing my first ever public tech talk for
[SEVDNUG](http://twitter.com/sevdnug). It’s on Oct 28th. [Details
here](http://sevdnug.org/events/meetings/SEVDNUG_October_2010_Meeting.aspx).

It’s an introductory to NoSQL, and what its about. There will be .Net
code albeit simplistic (its just an introductory). If you don’t already
have a fair grasp of NoSQL, you will by then end of this talk. Even if
you do have a nosql clue, you should come anyway. Likely it will be an
explosive success or a bombing failure; either way there will be
fireworks.

Come prepared to participate in discussion. I’ll have a talk prepared,
but I’m fine with the audience hijacking it and we end up messing around
with code.

So Oct 28th. 6pm. [Gangplank](http://gangplankhq.com) in Chander, AZ.
