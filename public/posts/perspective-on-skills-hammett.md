perspective on skills: hammett
------------------------------

Mon August 08, 2011

Hammett (Hamilton Ver√≠ssimo) is the founder of the [Castle
Project](http://castleproject.org/), which I am very partial to. It's a
great project with great tools for MVC, IoC, etc. He recently left
working for Microsoft as a PM. Honestly, I feel a bit honored that he
was willing to respond, as I am with all those who have.\
\
 **1. What are your normal toolsets and coding environment? Meaning what
language, IDE, and OS do you use most of the time; and anything else
that comes to mind.**\
 Usually it's a combination of VS 2010, F\#/C\# and Aptana for
Html/css/js. I'm on Win7.\
\
 **2. Would you consider yourself pro-Microsoft, anti-Microsoft, or
neutral? Why?**\
 Neutral. I do appreciate MS' pragmatic approach in its platform,
especially when compared to Java. .Net's API is way more friendly and
task oriented than Java's purist approach. Things also tend to be high
quality/stable. when compared to pure OSS platforms, such as Ruby.\
\
 The downside is the innovation is usually constraint by MS' ability to
see future and trends, and they havent been good at that.
Ruby/Python/OSS in general move faster, create new trends, all in the
name of boosting productivity and enabling new business models. MS and
Java play a catch up game in this aspect.\
\
 **3. What personal decisions or thoughts led to your current coding
preferences?**\
 F\# is just very productive to me. C\# is just well-known currently,
and that's the only reason I use it.\
\
 **4. If there was some business motivation, could you briefly explain
it?**\
 \[did not answer\]\
\
 **5. What are the best points of your current coding environment?**\
 Not sure. I still feel that Eclipse is a superior tool/environment. And
it's free. VS is expensive, slow, memory eater, impossible to use
without resharper and be productive, but there's not other serious
competing offer. Since MS usually release platform changes (CLR +
Libraries) at the same time with Visual Studio, it's hard for 3rd
parties to compete in the IDE space as MS will always have a head
start.\
\
 **6. If applicable: What if anything do you miss from your previous
coding environment?**\
 From java, I miss how open, extensible and embraced Eclipse was. I miss
the abundance of decent OSS offering, Apache projects, and so on.
Everything was customizable, pluggable.\
\
 From Ruby I miss the bleeding edge, the experimentation and forward
thinking.\
\
 **7. Anything else you want to mention or promote?**\
 Use Castle :-)\
\
 Hammett is smart and hardworking, and willing to forge a new path when
it makes sense. It's definitely worth following his
[blog](http://hammett.castleproject.org/) to see what he's up to. Maybe
you'll get luck and have a chance to hire him.\
