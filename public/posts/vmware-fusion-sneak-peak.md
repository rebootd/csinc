vmware fusion sneak peak
------------------------

Wed June 03, 2009

I’ve been granted a sneak peak of VMWare Fusion v.next. While I’m not
sure why I was selected, I sure do appreciate it. There are rules to
follow, and I don’t think I’m breaking any by telling you that the next
version looks good. I didn’t do anything special. Just installed and
ran, then opened my Windows 7 RC machine. Worked fine; perhaps a little
better since the usual mangled boot screen wasn’t nearly as bad. In the
current released Fusion, Win 7 boot screen gets a little weird and plays
disco-flashy or something for a few seconds before going to the login
screen. Some else saw it and declared my MBP was possessed. Anyway, the
rules prevent me from saying too much specific but I can say it looks
good so far. With Windows 7 due around [October
22](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10253924-56.html) of this year,
looks like VMWare Fusion will be ready for it.

I will be using it run Win7, and do some development work on it. I’ve
also booted Ubuntu 9.04, Fedora 10, and WinXP. All ran fine.

It just sunk in as I wrote this that I am running Visual Studio 2010
Beta on Windows 7 Release Candidate in VMWare Fusion Beta.
