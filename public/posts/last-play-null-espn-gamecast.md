last play: null - espn gamecast

pulled up ESPN's Gamecast to follow the Cleveland Cavs game while I
worked tonight. I happened to flip over to the window in time to see and
capture this picture. This is fairly off topic but still, its an obvious
programming error. I'd have to guess there was a null or empty field in
the last update message. I typically follow with ESPN Gamecast and its
gotten to be a pretty reliable service. Wasn't always, but haven't had
problems with it in a year or more.
