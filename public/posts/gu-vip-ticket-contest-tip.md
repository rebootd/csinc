gu vip ticket contest tip
-------------------------

Wed May 13, 2009

Alrighty.. Thought I’d drop a hint, and possibly help make the decision
easier for us. The [VIP tickets](http://scottgu2009.eventbrite.com/)
currently stand at 84 left. Any entrants who help sell 3+ additional VIP
seats will get extra consideration when choosing the winner. It won’t
lock you into winning it, but it will be VERY compelling.

No, we don’t get a kick back. This is about promoting the event, and
this would really help us decide which of the worthy entrants to pick
when it is time.

Blog it, Tweet it, Facebook it, Email it, print and post it. Then email
(contact \[at\] computeristsolutions \[dot\] com) us proof with the name
and last 7 digits of the order number.

Don’t forget, the prize is a VIP ticket (front seat, power outlet,
internet access) plus Vista, Office Ultimate, and Visual Studio 2008
Pro. You must attend to receive the software though. The contest clock
is counting down. Better hurry.
