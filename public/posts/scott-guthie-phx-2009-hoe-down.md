Tue May 26, 2009

I’m at the Scott Guthrie Event in Phx (Scottsdale actually), and have
already see [Dave Campbell](http://www.wynapse.com/), [Rachel
Reese](http://twitter.com/rachelreese), [Scott
Cate](http://timheuer.com/blog/), [Tim
Heuer](http://timheuer.com/blog/), [Joe
Guadagno](http://www.josephguadagno.net/), and some other old friends.
ScottGu is talking now so I’m keeping this short. Rachel is trying to
take pictures and hopefully you can see some pics on [Rachel’s twitter
feed](http://twitter.com/rachelreese).
[Scott](http://twitter.com/scottcate) and
[Joe](http://twitter.com/jguadagno) are taking pics too.
