whats hot according to me
-------------------------

Thu May 05, 2011

Every once in a while, I take stock of what the current hot trends are
in technology. It’s non-scientific, and completely based on my own
observations. Sometimes, I’ll list a few as recommend tools because I
like them. This time they’re getting posted straight up with no
pretense.

I’m going to start with one that’s based merely on one persons comments
and projects: [Rob Conery](http://twitter.com/robconery). Massive and
Manatee are projects he has on his [github](http://github.com/robconery)
account. They are both minimal libraries for doing some basic things:
data access & schema migrations. He’s stated that there’s a minimalist
movement in .Net. Personally, he’s the only one I’ve seen saying stuff
like that.

So here’s what I think is hot now and trending that way in the near
future.

**Hot**\

-   minimal .Net (via [@robconery](http://twitter.com/robconery))
-   Javascript
-   [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) (recommend
    [nodester](http://nodester.com))
-   Platform as a service (PAAS) a la [Heroku](http://heroku.com),
    [Nodester](http://nodester.com)
-   [WebGL](http://learningwebgl.com) (more javascript stuff)
-   Voice/sms enabled apps & voip services like
    [twilio](http://twilio.com), [tropo](http://tropo.com), etc
-   mobile platforms, especially
    [Android](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) (dont forget
    [iOS](http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action))
-   Mono base tools such as [MonoTouch](http://monotouch.net/),
    [MonoDroid](http://mono-android.net/), and
    [MonoMac](http://www.mono-project.com/MonoMac) (up in the air with
    recent Novell changes)
-   [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) (personal experience.. its a really nice
    OS; looks ready for average users to me)
-   [Nuget](http://nuget.codeplex.com) (it’s one of those little things
    that keeps .Net a good platform)
-   [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) (I still see a huge potential
    here; getting less traction that it deserves)
-   [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) -
    maybe you haven’t realized it but both Rails and (now) MS MVC tend
    to promote RESTful methods in controllers. MS is also added REST to
    other stuff they have cooking.
-   [JSON](http://www.json.org/) - so much better than XML for simple
    data transport markup
-   [Jenkins CI](http://jenkins-ci.org) - really great CI server & super
    easy to get going with it
-   [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) with
    [Albacore](https://github.com/derickbailey/Albacore) for building
    .Net projects
-   [MS MVC 3](http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc3) with
    [Razor](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/07/02/introducing-razor.aspx)
    view engine ..really an excellent job from DevDiv
-   [OpenGov](http://opengovernment.org/) movement - opening up data and
    documents for our governments to the public
-   [RavenDB](http://ravendb.net/) & [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)

\
\
 **Cool but haven't tried**\

-   [knowckout js](http://knockoutjs.com/)

\
\
 **Warm**\

-   [Selenium 2](http://seleniumhq.org/)
-   [Watin](http://watin.org/)
-   Mocking - starting to think this is more a necessity for static
    languages and completely pointless for dynamic languages
-   HTML 5 - this is clearly the future, and it looks good. Just too
    early with spotty support across browsers. Browser support will
    probably look much better in a year.
-   [Studio Styles](http://studiostyl.es/) - VS themes, good for better
    color schemes, better on your eyes

\
\

As I thought about these, I couldn’t help thinking of a couple things
that I’d consider to be not hot. So here ya go.

**Not Hot**\

[Visual Studio 2010](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/home) -
VS2010 is clunky; lots of good; lots of annoying. DevDiv is pretty good
so I’d be surprised if they didn’t have it more ironed out next time.

[EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) - This is largely due to the recent
Amazon EC2 outtage. It looks like they made the most of the learning
opportunity so this is probably a short lived Not Hot.

[Flash](http://www.adobe.com/flash) - This is probably permanently on my
Not Hot list.

[HAML](http://haml-lang.com/)/[nHAML](https://github.com/NHaml/NHaml) -
Sorry, but I’m a simplist and these add unnecessary complexity

[Cucumber](http://cukes.info/) - For the sample reason as with HAML,
even though I like Cucumber
