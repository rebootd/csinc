visualhg and visual studio
--------------------------

Sun March 27, 2011

This is just a quick observation. Apparently when you are creating a new
project from an empty cloned repo, you have to first add the project
manually before using VisualHG. Otherwise it seems to crash Visual
Studio. Once that's done, it works well.\
\
 Just thought I'd make a quick note in case anyone else runs into this,
or knows a way around it.\

 Oh, and it's nice to be able to connect to VPN long enough to
synchronize your repository, and then disconnect again and continue
working. This may matter more when you're on the road. Or if you have
weird issues with VPN causing your Macbook to completely freeze up once
in a while. (like me)
