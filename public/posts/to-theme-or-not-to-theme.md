Having a consistent look and feel to a website or application is
important. Clearly we are breaking that rule. Adding the appropriate
theme is an agenda item, but it's not at the top of the todo list. It's
only a matter of time. But why post this? Because we like feedback.
Listening to the customer is what keeps us in business, and most of the
time it's fun to work together. Even when it's not all fun and games,
there is a sense of accomplishment from pulling together and getting
things done.

Personally, I'm pretty happy with the main layout and style. It has
evolved a little from the original, and I think it works. I like the
color scheme and layout. But would it work for a blog? Does anyone else
really care, or am I getting a little obsessed with details?

The general vision is that the blog entries would appear in the same
area as the welcome text on the [home page](/). The usual blogroll and
link would go where the side nav does on the main side. I'm not sure,
but there is some opinion on even keeping the top nav on the blog area
too. It may honestly be a while before we get to it, but you never know.
I could get an itch one night and decide to hack away.
