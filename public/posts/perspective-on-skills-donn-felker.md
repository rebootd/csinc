perspective on skills: donn felker
----------------------------------

Mon June 27, 2011

Donn is one of those guys that I think has the best job in the world or
something. Seriously, the guy gets to do all sorts of cool stuff. He's
also local to me (again) having moved back from MNPLS. Which also means
we're in the same user group again, if I ever manage to get out of my
cave and go. He's also apparently very practical in his technology
choices.\
\
 **1. What are your normal toolsets and coding environment? Meaning what
language, IDE, and OS do you use most of the time; and anything else
that comes to mind.**\
 Tools and IDEs: IntelliJ, Command Line, RubyMine, TeamCity, TextMate,
Git, Mercurial and Visual Studio with ReSharper. Languages: Java, C\#,
Ruby,Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET, HTML, JavaScript\
\
 **2. Would you consider yourself pro-Microsoft, anti-Microsoft, or
neutral? Why?**\
 Neutral. I use whatever tool gets the job done.\
\
 **3. What personal decisions or thoughts led to your current coding
preferences?**\
 The tools that make me the most productive are going to be my favorite.
If it slows me down, I'm not using it (unless that is the only tool I
can use to get the job done).\
\
 **4. If there was some business motivation, could you briefly explain
it?**\
 Speed equals faster time to market. Faster development means faster to
market. Faster to market can and usually does mean a larger initial
market share.\
\
 **5. What are the best points of your current coding environment?**\
 Refactoring and navigation tools. If I have to touch the mouse I'm not
liking it.\
\
 **6. If applicable: What if anything do you miss from your previous
coding environment?**\
 Not much.\
\
 **7. Anything else you want to mention or promote?**\
 Nada.\
\
 Since, Donn declines to offer any plugs, please see his info below.
He's a good developer among other things, and currently local to the PHX
area. I wouldn't hesitate to contact him for development services even
if you're not in the area.\
