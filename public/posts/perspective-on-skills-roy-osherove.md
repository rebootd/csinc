perspective on skills: roy osherove
-----------------------------------

Wed September 14, 2011

Roy Osherove is a developer, author, trainer, and prolific advocate of
unit testing your code. He is also a former .Net developer now focused
on Ruby. I probably learned of Roy during the birth of the alt.net
movement; from what I can remember. To me, he is like the Godfather of
.Net Unit Testing. ([Brad Wilson](https://twitter.com/bradwilson) is the
funny .Net Unit Testing nephew. Or something.)\
\
 I thought it would be interesting to get perspective from a well-known
.Net dev who has really thrown himself into a new development language
and toolset. Why? What lessons has he learned? If you are thinking about
it, is there some advice you could gather from him? Perhaps. Let's see
what Roy thinks..\
\
 **1. What are your normal toolsets and coding environment? Meaning what
language, IDE, and OS do you use most of the time; and anything else
that comes to mind.**\
 Normal? tough question. Before jumping into ruby it was VS 2010 +
resharper, NUnit and more. I actually did a whole talk about my tool.
the video is here:

\
 **2. Would you consider yourself pro-Microsoft, anti-Microsoft, or
neutral? Why?**\
 I'm pretty anti Microsoft these days, because I feel that I've been
used and thrown away, and my 6 year efforts to bring unit testing and
TDD to .NET have been hampered directly by decisions made by Microsoft
with regards to the tools, ecosystem and teachings. Read more about that
here:
<http://7enn.com/2011/07/04/appreciating-the-power-of-a-true-community/>
The interesting thing is that, to achieve this realization I had to get
out of my comfort zone and try a whole new community (Ruby). I needed to
be out of the system to understand its behavior, instead of trying to do
what I thought was "fighting from within".\
\
 **3. What personal decisions or thoughts led to your current coding
preferences?**\
 The previous answer, mostly. also, because I didn't want to be a
desktop developer for the rest of my professional life. I wanted to
learn web, and it was too hard to do on the MS stack. on the ruby/rails
stack things flow much easier for me.\
\
 **4. If there was some business motivation, could you briefly explain
it?**\
 I didn't want to be only associated with TDD in .NET. I wanted to
reinvent myself with TDD in Ruby, as well as team leadership (which has
always been my secondary passion - see <http://5whys.com> )\
\
 **5. What are the best points of your current coding environment?**\
 Since I'm using macvim (or gvim or just vim) it's lightweight (so it
can run on a macbook air without a problem. it's also conssisten when
connecting to remote machines (via ssh) so you get up and running very
quickly.\
\
 **6. If applicable: What if anything do you miss from your previous
coding environment?**\
 Refactoring and debugging in vim are not great. I'm still not crazy
about those experiences. resharper did that well.\
\
 **7. Anything else you want to mention or promote?**\
 no\

 Roy is currently a Ruby intern at [Astrails](http://astrails.com/). I
hope he is enjoying his work there. While I understand he is newer to
Ruby but strong development fundamentals cross boundaries. It's hard to
see "intern" next to the name of the guy I learned so much from. By the
way, he has a nice [TDD book](http://manning.com/osherove/) at
[Manning.com](http://manning.com/).\
\
 Clearly, Roy is very passionate about testing which has led him to move
away from .Net. I'm not as focused on that aspect of the .Net stack, so
my opinion is slight different. (I view MS as following and 5 years
behind; which means .Net devs are falling behind.) Still, the point is
clear. Choose the tooling that let's you get your job done without
getting in your way. If your toolset gets in the way, maybe you should
consider a new one. Best of luck to Roy Osherove, and everyone else!
