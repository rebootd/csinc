learning with podcasts
----------------------

Fri June 19, 2009

A lot of us devs listen to music while working. Why not learn something
at the same time, or even sit back and learn while not working? I do,
and wanted to share a few good sources.

I’m a little late to the party, but I’ve noticed this podcast series
called [Herding Code](http://herdingcode.com/), which looks great!
There’s a lot of topics so go check it out and be sure to check out
[this episode](http://herdingcode.com/?p=187) with [Damien
Guard](http://damieng.com/).

I also recommend [Hanselminutes](http://www.hanselminutes.com/),
[Railscasts](http://railscasts.com/), [NPR’s
Cartalk](http://cartalk.com/), and [Coffee Break
Spanish](http://rlnvault.com/rln09/shows/spanish/coffee-break-spanish/)
(along with other [Lingua Network
podcasts](http://www.radiolingua.com/ourpodcasts/index.html)).
