**Extra Power**

If you use a laptop as a main dev box, keep a second power cord in your
laptop bag. That way all you have to do to hit the road is unplug it and
slip it into you laptop bag. I typically keep my laptop bag ready to go,
so the only thing I need to add before I leave is the laptop itself and,
sometimes, the wireless mouse.

**Ubuntu CD**

I carry one in my laptop bag and have one in my home desk. Iâ€™ve saved
files being lossed many times by booting
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/), mounting the drive, and copying them
to a USB drive.

**TDD.Net**

I write unit tests, and strive to use TDD all of the time. Running tests
and getting the results is important. I find the Visual Studio test
runner to be too slow. [TestDriven.Net](http://www.testdriven.net/) is
my favorite test runner and VS add-in.
