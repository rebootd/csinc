quid pro quo para jeremy miller

Tue May 05, 2009

I don't normally post my own links on other people's blogs, but I did
today on Jeremy Miller's blog. He had a post on [revitalizing an IT
career](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2009/05/05/revitalizing-a-technical-career.aspx).
I thought someone might find my related blabbering useful. I felt like
posting a link to his article to be fair. (Yes, I mixed Latin and
Spanish in the title.)
