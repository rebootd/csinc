upgrade to blogengine.net 1.5.1.x
---------------------------------

Tue June 02, 2009

Weâ€™ve update the blog to v1.5.1.x in hopes that the future post problem
is resolved in the current Trunk of the BlogEngine.Net source code. This
also means we built it from source; hence the .x in the version number.
Hopefully this post will show up on time which means we accomplished our
goal.

The previous version had a problem with future posts not showing up at
the selected time; at least in conjunction with Live Writer. That and
some bug fixes should be the only changes.
