switching to feedburner
-----------------------

Wed March 04, 2009

Brief technical note.  We're switching to feedburner for our
syndication. I wanted to track subscriptions because I'm curious about
that. I figured it's early enough into this that it shouldn't be a
problem. I'm guessing there's only a few subscribers so far; using
Feedburner means I won't have to guess. Apologies for any inconvenience.
