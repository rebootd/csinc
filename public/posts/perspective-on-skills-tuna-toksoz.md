perspective on skills: tuna toksoz
----------------------------------

Thu July 28, 2011

Tuna is from Turkey and his big claim to fame (according to me) is being
a contributor to the Castle project and NHibernate. Apparently he's one
smart cookie and is currently enrolled at MIT. While he's done a lot of
good work in .Net, he's been doing a lot of stuff on linux; and
something to do with robotics. So I was really curious what his
perspective is.\
\
 **1. What are your normal toolsets and coding environment? Meaning what
language, IDE, and OS do you use most of the time; and anything else
that comes to mind.**\
 Recently, I shifted to Linux specifically Fedora as my coding OS. I
find it a great developer environment, as lots of libraries and other
stuff are pretty easy to install. I use Eclipse as my main IDE to do
Python Development. Although C\# is my strongest language, I don't do it
these days.\
\
 **2. Would you consider yourself pro-Microsoft, anti-Microsoft, or
neutral? Why?**\
 Mostly Pro-Microsoft. I wish I could do more MS development. No reason
why, I probably like the language and people from microsoft.\
\
 **3. What personal decisions or thoughts led to your current coding
preferences?**\
 Current coding preferences were kind of enforced, we've been using c++
and c and python in the lab, so this is what I took over and continued.
I also did some C\# last year on a 3D visualization environment, but it
was because I am strong in c\#\
\
 **4. If there was some business motivation, could you briefly explain
it?**\
 N/A\
\
 **5. What are the best points of your current coding environment?**\
 It's open and extensible. Eclipse is an incredible IDE which is easy to
extend. SVN integration? No brainer. You want to do python development
in addition to C++ and Java? Pretty easy as well. As a language, Python
provides a lot flexibility in what I do. It's dynamic structure allows
me to use every single part of it, to an extend where I feel like i am
abusing its dynamic nature :)\
\
 **6. If applicable: What if anything do you miss from your previous
coding environment?**\
 Not really.\
\
 **7. Anything else you want to mention or promote?**\
 I wish we used Git instead of SVN\

 I don't know what Tuna wants to do after school, but I think potential
employers should start lining up now. He is friendly, smart, and
driven.\
