rob conery nails it
-------------------

Wed April 22, 2009

I respect Rob Conery. He does an excellent job with his screencasts, has
good blog posts, and is generally a good/helpful guy. He nails ASP.Net
webforms and mvc in the same
[post](http://blog.wekeroad.com/blog/i-spose-ill-just-say-it-you-should-learn-mvc/).
To be clear he, and myself, are pro-MVC. Check out my [MVC Argument For
Humans](http://computeristsolutions.com/blog/post/MVC-Rave.aspx) post if
you don't believe me.

So go and read it. Here is the
[link](http://blog.wekeroad.com/blog/i-spose-ill-just-say-it-you-should-learn-mvc/)
again if you missed it earlier.
