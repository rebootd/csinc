why i dont hate android
-----------------------

Thu January 12, 2012

I recently saw [this
article](http://parislemon.com/post/15604811641/why-i-hate-android)
linked on HackerNews, which explains why MC Seigler hates Android.
(**TL;DR:** I can't have the whole pie so I don't even want a slice.)

**Ok...**

It's a good article with valid information, I just don't agree with the
conclusion. Sure Android is flawed and could be better. Lots of us would
have liked to have a lot more, but I'll happily take a slice over
nothing at all.

**Android gives us options**

Look at where we are versus where we were in the mobile phone market.
Now look at your choices. IPhone is a good phone, but some of us want a
little more and like to customize our phone. Blackberry? Windows Phone?
Nothing at all?

Android gives us options both on the phone and other devices. Maybe
something better will come along, or Android itself will continue to get
better. Cellular networks take big investments, and it's just not that
feasible to have a phone that can be switched to a different network on
a whim. As long as customers have choices, things will get better as
companies compete for customers.

**Personally...**

In the meantime, I like Android. And I respect iPhone. Windows Phone has
a lot to prove still, but maybe that will get better too. Western life
is pretty amazing, and we should all be a little more grateful instead
of complaining and holding your breath until you turn blue when you
can't have the whole pie all at once.
