blogengine.net 1.5.0.7 future post problem
------------------------------------------

Fri May 22, 2009

I’ve only seen this mentioned on the
[forums](http://blogengine.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=55914),
so I figured I should post it. Apparently there is a bug with future
posts in be.net 1.5.0.7. I tried to update to update to the latest but
ran into a problem with .Net runtime.  It’s something I can handle when
I get time.

In the meantime, be advised; and see help on the
[forums](http://www.codeplex.com/blogengine/Thread/List.aspx) if you
need it.
