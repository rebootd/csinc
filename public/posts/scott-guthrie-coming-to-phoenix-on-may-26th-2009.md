Wed April 22, 2009

[Scott Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/) is coming to Phoenix
again this year. The event is on May 26, 2009 from 8am to 6pm. It's a
Tuesday. I have to say the Gu is a great presenter; and there's a bonus.
[Glenn Block](http://blogs.msdn.com/gblock/) will also be presenting.
He's one of the guys behind MEF. You should go learn about Glenn and
[MEF](http://www.codeplex.com/MEF) right now! Although I'm not familiar
with him,Â [Jaime Rodriguez](http://blogs.msdn.com/jaimer/) is also
presenting. I'm going to go read his blog myself.

The event page is [here](http://scottgu2009.eventbrite.com/).

Barring major catastrophe, I will be there. It's always a great event.
HIGHLY recommended.

**UPDATE:** It is free!
