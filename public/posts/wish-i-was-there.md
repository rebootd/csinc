![](/blog/image.axd?picture=2009%2f3%2fRWS2-Big.jpg) I \*really\* wanted
to go to Alt.Net Seattle 2009. I even made plans and made sure I had a
spot (thanks to Glenn Block for helping with that). It just wasn't in
the cards. I will make it to some Alt.Net event this year; it probably
won't have as many really cool developers as AltNet Sea. That doesn't
mean I or yourself can't enjoy some of the content. A few of the
attendees have been blogging about the event.  I'm linking some that I
know of below. I'm sure there is more, and more will probably be posted
after people have a chance to get back to the real world.

So what would it take to get something like this to happen in the
Phoenix, AZ area? It helps AltNetSea is near Microsoft headquarters
where lots of really smart programmers live & work. It also helps that
MIX09 is the week after the weekend AltNetSea event, so a lot of those
guys are going to be in town anyway. We have our share of smartu guys,
and a few good community leaders. Also Scott Gu has been coming to town
yearly for a while now.  What about something right about the same time,
assuming he comes this year again?

Just a thought. There is also [Alt.Net
Houston](http://houston.altnetconf.com/home) coming up.
