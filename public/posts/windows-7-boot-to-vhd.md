windows 7 boot to vhd
---------------------

Thu May 21, 2009

Win7 can boot directly to a VHD aka Virtual Hard Drive. ScottHa explains
it
[here](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/LessVirtualMoreMachineWindows7AndTheMagicOfBootToVHD.aspx).
Basically, your virtual machine becomes a dual boot OS if you want. I
like the option and will begin to campaign for the same thing with OSX
and/or Fusion.

Fusion can boot a Bootcamp partition as a vm, but thatâ€™s not the same
thing.
