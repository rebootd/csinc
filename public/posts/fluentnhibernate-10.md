[James
Gregory](http://blog.jagregory.com/2009/08/16/fluent-nhibernate-10rc/)
and friends have brought FluentNHibernate up to 1.0 RC with RTM expected
soon. If you haven’t heard about
[FluentNH](http://fluentnhibernate.org/) or
[NHibernate](https://www.hibernate.org/343.html), please go learn about
it. I wouldn’t hesitate to use it now, and started playing with it from
source a few weeks ago. I’m using it on one particular project along
with [FluentMigrator](http://code.google.com/p/fluentmigrator/) (more on
that coming soon).
