the gu shift
------------

Wed May 27, 2009

I was at the Scott Gu Conference in Phoenix yesterday, which was a great
event as it always is. Many thanks go to [Joe
Guadagno](http://www.josephguadagno.net/) of
[SEVDNUG](http://www.sevdnug.org/) and [Scott Cate](http://mykb.com/) of
[AZGROUPS](http://azgroups.org/). You know what you’re going to get when
**Teh Gu** talks. He’s a good presenter; natural, funny, open, and
accessible. There were two other softies presenting too: Glenn Block and
Jaime Rodriguez. Both were great. Glenn did an excellent job, which I
poorly covered
[here](http://computeristsolutions.com/blog/post/Glenn-Block-On-MEF.aspx).
I knew a little about Glenn so it wasn’t a surprise, but Jamie was a
surprise. He too did a great job. I don’t know where MS finds these
techies who also happen to be good public speakers. Maybe they train
them?

I was thinking about the people working for Gu and how different those
teams are from the image of the rest of Microsoft. It really seems like
the culture is shifting, and Gu has just a great group of people. They
are open and accessible, and in many cases helpful beyond my
expectation. I think you should always give credit where credit is due,
and accordingly I want to point out how this has come about under the
leadership of Scott Guthrie.

I know of cases where Tim Heuer, Glenn Block, and Rob Conery were
voluntarily helpful out of their own kindness. Several people under Gu
are also OSS contributors or founders. I think its a great thing, and it
appears they all have fun doing what they do. Just a bunch of smart,
good people. Here’s a list of a few of them:

There are a lot more of course, but just a little credit where a lot is
due. Thanks to all.
