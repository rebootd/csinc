perspective on skills: justin etheredge
---------------------------------------

Tue August 02, 2011

I don't remember how it was I came to follow Justin Etheredge but I've
subscribed to his blog forever it seems like. He is one of the original
authors of the OSS project I currently/occasionally contribute to; that
being [FluentMigrator](https://github.com/schambers/fluentmigrator). He
is one of the short list of people who influenced my techy thoughts most
(this series has most of the others). Naturally, I had to wonder... What
Would Justin Do?\
\
 **1. What are your normal toolsets and coding environment? Meaning what
language, IDE, and OS do you use most of the time; and anything else
that comes to mind.**\
 For most of my professional coding I'm writing in C\# in Visual Studio
2010 running in Windows 7. I've got to have Resharper running or it
drives me nuts, the Resharper shortcuts have become second nature to me
and when I don't have them, I feel a bit sluggish. Most all of the
coding I do personally these days is in Rails. I started off using
TextMate a while back, but now I use MacVim for everything. It was a bit
of a challenge at first, but I actually got used to it a whole lot
faster than I thought I would. I'm still not as fast as I am with Visual
Studio and Resharper, but that will take time. With MacVim I use a very
slightly modified version of Janus (https://github.com/carlhuda/janus)
along with PeepOpen. I use Git for source control on basically
everything right now.\
\
 **2. Would you consider yourself pro-Microsoft, anti-Microsoft, or
neutral? Why?**\
 Neutral. Microsoft isn't a single company. They may operate under one
name, but they are several companies in one. I would probably say that I
feel positive towards DevDiv, they have done so many great things over
the last few years. Unfortunately I can't say the same thing about other
parts of the company.\
\
 **3. What personal decisions or thoughts led to your current coding
preferences?**\
 I love to create things, and I don't want my tools in the way.
Resharper allows me to keep a better flow when producing code. It allows
me to more quickly change directions in my code, or to navigate from one
place to another. So I really just want an environment that allows me to
quickly produce code so that I can build software.\
\
 **4. If there was some business motivation, could you briefly explain
it?**\
 Productivity. I want to be productive, end of story. Productivity is a
kinda loaded term though. You can trade immediate productivity for
future productivity. You can trade productivity in production for
productivity in maintenance. At the end of the day though, it is all
about producing software which provides value to your customer. Being
productive is a big part of that, business moves so fast these days, if
you aren't producing quickly then you'll likely be left behind.\
\
 **5. What are the best points of your current coding environment?**\
 With Visual Studio I'd say the best part is really how integrated
everything is now. Microsoft gives you this environment in which you
rarely have to leave Visual Studio (with Resharper!) for anything. This
makes it easy to get setup and running. Unfortunately it also constrains
you sometimes. People who refuse to use tools outside of Visual Studio
miss a lot. Things like CI servers, build scripts, etc... often aren't
as easy to use as just hitting "Build" inside of Visual Studio, and so
many developers write them off.\
\
 With MacVim I'd say the best part is the lightness of it all.
Everything is so snappy and fast. It gives me the syntax highlighting,
formatting, navigation, etc... that I get with Visual Studio and
Resharper, and it starts up instantly and can run just as nicely on a
netbook as it does on my MacBook. The one thing I do miss is some of the
refactoring support, but I've tried to Ruby IDEs and they just feel like
"too much".\
\
 **6. If applicable: What if anything do you miss from your previous
coding environment?**\
 My previous coding environment before Visual Studio was Delphi. So
honestly, not much! Maybe if you asked me this question back in the
early 2000's there would have been some parts of the Delphi IDE which
were better, but VS2010 is way ahead now.\
\
 As far as working in MacVim (and before that TextMate), this is
honestly the first time since college that I have really worked outside
of an IDE. Modern text editors though provide most of the niceties these
days that you would expect from an IDE. So honestly, I enjoy working
inside of a text editor, and I rarely miss my IDE.\
\
 **7. Anything else you want to mention or promote?**\
 I blog pretty regularly over at
[CodeThinked.com](http://www.codethinked.com/) and my company Ecstatic
Labs (http://ecstaticlabs.com/) just got off the ground about a year
ago.\

 Justin's work, to me, is quintessentially pragmatic and yet also
striving to the highest quality. Seems striving for better is a common
theme for him; which is a hallmark of a driven developer. You know.. the
type you should hire instead of that "current student, senior developer
with 10 years of asp/mvc/ruby/mongo/mysql/abc/xyz" from craigslist. (no
offense to CL)\
\
 Honestly, I'll be taking a look at those Vim plugins soon as I can. I
could stand to improve my \[Mac\]Vim skills a bit. I've also noticed a
common theme in these regarding Microsoft; that's for a separate post
though. For now, check out [Ecstatic Labs](http://ecstaticlabs.com/).\
