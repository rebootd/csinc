think you know your coding language
-----------------------------------

Think you know your primary coding language? Try translating it to
another programming language.\
\
 I've been doing C\# since .Net 1.0 Beta. I feel pretty comfortable in
the language and the .Net Framework. While I recognize that I don't know
every bit of it, I'm pretty confident with it. Yesterday and today, I
had to convert a function from C\# to Ruby. I know Ruby decently well
and assumed it would be easy. Nope.\
\
 Actually the completed work was easy in retrospect, but I was confusing
myself with how to handle the char type from C\# and bitwise operations.
When you need to explain something (or translate), you will truly find
out how well you know it or how valid your assumptions are.\
\
 As an aside, I found using Mono & Monodevelop to test my C\# output for
comparison to the Ruby output to be very helpful. Normally I run a
virtual machine to do C\# work on my macbook. Mono made it a lot easier
and faster. So, a little public thanks for those who contribute and to
[Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/).
