guess what i'm reading

![](/blog/image.axd?picture=2009%2f4%2fbaley_cover150.jpg)So I mentioned
on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/joshcoffman) that I was reading
Ayende's [DSL with Boo](http://manning.com/rahien/) book, and I
recommend it. I thought it fair to mention what I'm reading now that
I've finished it. Without looking at the picture to the left, can anyone
guess? Hint: It's related to the work I'm currently doing with an
existing application. Yeah, you guessed it. [Brownfield Application
Development in .Net](http://manning.com/baley/) by Kyle Baley and Don
Belcham. How'd you know? I'm really busy so I'm not making quick
progress; even
my [leisure](/blog/post/Leisure-Reading-For-Enhanced-Performance.aspx) reading
is on hold.

I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that one or both of the authors have
worked with or trained with [JP
Boodhoo](http://blog.jpboodhoo.com/) because he's already been
mentioned. I like that it's putting together a reasonable argument why
Brownfield isn't that bad. Even lays outs some reasons why its actually
a good situation. The first chapter is free so you can sample it
yourself.  Also, Manning emails coupons all the time so let me know if
you're thinking of buying.
