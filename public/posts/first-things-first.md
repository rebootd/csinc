first things first
------------------

Wed February 25, 2009

Welcome all. I thought for a while about what to say in a first blog
entry. I decided just an introduction and some goals would be best. As
you can see from the description, my name is Josh. I have many years of
experience, and occasionally a good idea or tip to share. I plan on
posting some of those tips and ideas, as well as a little bit of our
misadventures in technology. This isn't going to be a one-way blog
though. We're open to and hopeful for your feedback.

 **Goals**

-   share useful or time saving tips
-   post lessons learned
-   share some news about what we (or myself) are up to
-   have some discussion on technology, especially programming

We have some standards to aim for, but not a lot of time for our own
website.  We are still making changes as time permits.  The style and
layout of this blog is one of those things; it doesn't quite fit with
the rest of the site. I'll post updates as we make progress or just want
some feedback. We've already had some lessons learned from installing
the blog engine, and will share that at a later time.

So which is harder.. deciding on a post title or how to conclude? Well I
look forward to meeting you all. Please stop by often.

Thanks
