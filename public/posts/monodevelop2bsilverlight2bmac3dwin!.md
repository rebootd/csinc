[tweet](http://twitter.com/bradwilson/statuses/1741416728).. Here is a
[preview](http://www.go-mono.com/media/MonoDevelopMacMoonlightPreview.swf)
of Silverlight coding with MonoDevelop on Mac. I know, I know.. I'm
geeking out a little on Mono, MonoDevelop, and Mac. It's just that I
think .Net is a great platform, and it's very cool to see the
possibility of using it on non-Windows OS's. Mono really is a good
platform itself; makes it reasonable to build C\# code that works on
Windows, Mac, and Linux. The UI part of it might be a little different,
but still ..most excellent.

You know, I'm going to have to try it.

**Update**: yes, I tried it.
