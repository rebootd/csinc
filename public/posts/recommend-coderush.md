My name is Josh and I have a problem. I am a keyboard shortcut addict.
As such, I’ve found
[Resharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/index.html) restrictive
because it re-maps a lot of the shortcuts I use most often. Lots of devs
like it so don’t take my word for it. I have been using CodeRush
([express](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/dd218053.aspx),
[pro](http://www.devexpress.com/Products/Visual_Studio_Add-in/Coding_Assistance/))
more and more. As I do, I’m finding it’s gives you some nice features
without getting in the way of those nice shortcut keys.

What prompted this post is the handy little feature of cleaning up
unnecessary using statements and namespacing. Since I like clean, crisp
code, this really tickled my aesthetic senses. And earns a +1 for
CodeRush.
