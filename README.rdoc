Hosted on Heroku, built with Ruby on Rails 4.x, AngularJS 1.x, and MongoDB (hosted on MongoLab).

I set up git remotes for github, a test app on heroku, and the live app on heroku. Normal deployment flow starts with git commit, then 'git push && git push test master'. Once the test app is up and looks fine, I push to production.
